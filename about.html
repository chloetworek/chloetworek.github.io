<h1>About Me</h1>

Hi, my name is <strong>Chloe Tworek</strong>. I created this website to show the programming I wrote in my CSC106 course at the University of Rhode Island. I am currently a freshman <a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/ccj/">Criminology & Criminal Justice major</a>, but taking the opportunity to explore other interests, such as computer science. <br>
<br>
I grew up in a small town, Hopkinton, New Hampshire, and love to spend my days outside. I enjoy hiking, swimming, and playing sports. During my first semester I joined the URI Women's Ultimate Frisbee team, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/campusrec/club-sports/ultimate-womens/">Disky Business,</a> with no experience, but it has been exciting to learn this new sport and be a part of the team environment. I strive to try new things and am excited for more adventures to come.
